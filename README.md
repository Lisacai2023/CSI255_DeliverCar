## Introduction:
- Provide context and motivations of the project.
    - Why did you decide to work on this project?
      - I never had the experience to create a game before. I decided to work on this project to learn the Unity engine and use it to design my first game. I also want to through the programming process to enhance my other coding language skills such as C# and Visual Studio Code. 
       
- What are your goals for this project?
  - To learn the Unity engine and develop a 2D mini kid-friendly game.
  - Continue to dive into C# and Visual Studio Code, and combine them into the game programming.
  - Practice creating whole process game programming. From the beginning of the concept to the end of the interactive game platform.
  - Practice designing user interactive game platforms to understand user experiences on the game.   
    
- What do you project your final project look like?
  - My final project will look like a 2D mini kid-friendly game. 2D game my idea is to design a game like car carries with package and delivery it. 
	 
- What are the specific features you deem required to implement for this project?
   - For 2D game, having a user interaction platform
       
- What are features that you would like to implement if given the time? (Pre-project)
  - I would like to implement 2D car design apperance.
  - In the different game levels have different maps.
- How difficult do you think this project will be?
  - I think it could be a lot of challenge for me because developing a game is new for me. I have to learn the whole process.
- What skills do you plan to develop with this project that will be useful for your job search?
  - Increase knowledge in C#, JavaScript and game engine software.
  - Practice in creating a project.
- What is the industry like for this kind of application (such as mobile application, web development, data analysis, etc.)?
  - Developing this project can teach me some basic knowledge about the entire game design process and user-interactive experience. This learning experience is useful in web development.

      - Add later
  - Explain team roles and procedures.
      - All me

## Requirements:
- What are the features that you plan to implement?
  - UI
  - For 2D car game: Controls, movement, pick up function, delivery function, change color
  - For 2D car game: geometric shape setting
  - Driving map 
  - Game background music

## Project Timeline:
- Provide a timeline overview, possibly as a Gantt chart or sequential list of milestones.
  - Week1:
      - Learning Modules materials, installing Unity
      - Learn the MongoDB tutorial
  - Week2
      - Working on the project proposal
      - Choose a project game
      - Review lecture 2 and follow the contents to practice
      - Set up a working system and create a file in Unity
  - Week3
      - Learn the Unity Engine tutorial in each week
      - Looking for the lecture on YouTube to know how to make a video game step by step, and watch it.
      - Practice each learning function in Unity Engine.
      - Create a car model and add movement fuction on the car.
  - Week4
      - Continue to Work on car moving function and test it.
      - Test control buttons.
      - Add second game object, colliders and rigid bodies functions make two objects can bump into each.
      - Learning realted tutorial.
      - Update project documentation.
  - Week5
      - Continue to add move control movement function on the car
      - Add Assets to project
  - Week6 5/12/2024
      - Add if statements and tags so that if we drive over a package that is tagged as customer. The statements print to the console package picked up or package 
        delivered.
      - Use bool function to make sure can only delivery a package if you actually have the package and verify cannot delivery a package over and over.
      - Add destroy function,  when picking up a package, the package disappears. Adding restriction condition allow to pick up one package each time.
    Lessons Learned:
      - Learning layer override priority function, put things in different layers when adding assets in game layout design.
      - How to disappears things by using destory funcition
      - Add tag to print interaction statements on the console.
  - Week7
    
  - Week8
    
  - Week9
    
  - Week10
  
  - Week11: Demonstration

## Future Work:
- Discuss potential new features or improvements for future versions.
    - What are features that you would like to implement, but are beyond the 3-month mark?
- Address any originally planned features not implemented and reasons behind it.
    - Update in the future
